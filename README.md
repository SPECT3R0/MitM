# Darkside - Offensive Network Security Framework

![Darkside Banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SPECT3R0/MitM/main/interface/darkside%20banner.png)

## Overview

Darkside is an advanced, offensive network security framework designed for performing Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. Developed by SPECT3R, it provides a modular and extensible platform for network penetration testing, including ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, SSL stripping, HTTP injection, traffic analysis, and more. Whether you're a penetration tester, red teamer, or security enthusiast, Darkside offers a powerful toolset to simulate and study network attacks in a controlled, ethical environment.

**This framework is built for educational purposes and should only be used on networks or systems you own or have explicit permission to test. Misuse of this tool can be illegal and unethical.**

## Features

- **Interactive Menu:** A user-friendly, executable menu for selecting and running commands without command-line arguments.
- **Command-Line Support:** Full support for running commands via terminal arguments for advanced users.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extensible with plugins for new attack types or modifications.
- **Real-Time Traffic Manipulation:** Supports ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, SSL stripping, HTTP injection, and network traffic analysis.
- **Logging:** Logs all activities to `echomitm.log` for debugging and auditing.
- **Cross-Platform:** Designed to run on Linux (tested on Kali Linux), with potential for adaptation to other Unix-like systems.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux or another Linux distribution (preferred for penetration testing).
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher.
- **Dependencies:**
  - `pyfiglet` for ASCII art
  - `termcolor` for colored terminal output
  - Ensure `interface/cli.py` and `modules/` are properly set up with their dependencies (e.g., Scapy for packet manipulation, if used).

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SPECT3R0/MitM.git
   cd MitM
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pyfiglet termcolor
   ```
   *Note: Additional dependencies may be required based on the modules in `interface/cli.py` and `modules/`. Refer to those files for specific requirements (e.g., Scapy, Netfilter, etc.).*

3. **Make `main.py` Executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x main.py
   ```

4. **Run with Root Privileges (Required for Network Operations):**
   Most MITM operations require root privileges to manipulate network traffic. Use `sudo` when running Darkside.

## Usage

Darkside supports two modes of operation: an interactive menu and command-line arguments. Below are detailed instructions for both.

### Interactive Menu

Run Darkside without arguments to access the interactive menu:

```bash
sudo ./main.py
```

This will display a banner and menu, allowing you to select commands by entering a number (1-7) or the command name. Example interaction:

```
=== Darkside Interactive Menu ===
1. arp_spoof: Perform ARP spoofing to intercept network traffic
2. dns_spoof: Spoof DNS responses to redirect traffic
3. ssl_strip: Strip SSL/TLS to downgrade HTTPS to HTTP
4. http_inject: Inject content (e.g., JavaScript) into HTTP responses
5. analyze: Analyze network traffic and log activities
6. stop: Stop all active operations and restore network state
7. exit: Exit the menu

=== Or Use Command-Line Examples ===
1. Show help: python3 main.py --help
2. Start ARP spoofing: python3 main.py arp_spoof
3. Inject JavaScript alert: python3 main.py http_inject -c "alert('Hacked by Darkside');"
4. Stop all operations: python3 main.py stop

Enter your choice (1-7) or command name: 1
[Running ARP spoofing...]
```

- For `http_inject`, you’ll be prompted to enter the content (e.g., JavaScript) to inject.
- Select `7` or type `exit` to quit the menu.

### Command-Line Usage

Run Darkside with specific commands and arguments. Use `sudo` for network operations:

#### Show Help
```bash
sudo ./main.py --help
```

#### ARP Spoofing
```bash
sudo ./main.py arp_spoof
```

#### DNS Spoofing
```bash
sudo ./main.py dns_spoof
```

#### SSL Stripping
```bash
sudo ./main.py ssl_strip
```

#### HTTP Injection
```bash
sudo ./main.py http_inject -c "alert('Hacked by Darkside');"
```
*Note: The `-c` or `--content` argument is required for `http_inject` to specify the content (e.g., JavaScript) to inject.*

#### Traffic Analysis
```bash
sudo ./main.py analyze
```

#### Stop Operations
```bash
sudo ./main.py stop
```

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The entry point with the interactive menu and command-line parser.
- `interface/cli.py`: Handles command execution and logic for each MITM attack.
- `modules/`: Contains modules for specific attacks (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS spoofing, etc.).
- `echomitm.log`: Logs all activities and errors for debugging.
- `config.yaml` (optional): Configuration file for settings like network interfaces, targets, etc.

## Dependencies

- **Python 3.8+**
- `pyfiglet`
- `termcolor`
- Additional dependencies in `interface/cli.py` and `modules/` (e.g., Scapy, Netfilter, etc.).
